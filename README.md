## How to use it ?

The idea is that can you get the news about movies who interested you. [**Sign in**](https://hubmovies-a26fc.firebaseapp.com/sign-in) for record movies in the playlists available. For the moment, two playlists exists: "watch later" and "favorites". Tell me if you want that I add new functions, I will try. 

My purpose is to built a great application as allocine or tv show time, using the power of Angular.
